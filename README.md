# Dissertation-UAlbany-LaTeX

This is designed to offer resource for people who wanted to write their dissertation in LaTeX format.  There are many online resources available.  However, it took me a long time to develop my customized template.  I felt that if anyone wanted to take advantage of this resource, it should be provided in full disclosure in spirit of open source and community-like development for ongoing improvement of overall quality of life.

As I progress on this project, I am confronted with several licensing issues.  I cannot turn over all files for a full compilation of same document that I generated with my tex file.  

At this point, I am inclined to leave it as it is, and if someone is interested in generating a copy, either create branch and we can work together to make a new version of this work.

A copy of original PDF file is provided for comparing purposes.
