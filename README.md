# Dissertation-UAlbany-LaTeX

This is designed to offer resource for people who wanted to write their dissertation in LaTeX format.  There are many online resources available.  However, it took me a long time to develop my customized template.  I felt that if anyone wanted to take advantage of this resource, it should be provided in full disclosure in spirit of open source and community-like development for ongoing improvement of overall quality of life.

As I progress on this project, I am confronted with several licensing issues.  I cannot turn over all files for a full compilation of same document that I generated with my tex file.  Therefore, an artistic license is provided as a safest path for all involved in this process.  Please feel free to contact me for additional modifications.  At this point, my recommended method is to clone this package, run LaTeX on your computer on your own branch, send me requests for additional files if needed (I did not include pictures as part of the package yet) then we can eventually work together if necessary to generate your own version.

A copy of original PDF file is provided for comparing purposes.  This PDF file was officially published as part of my PhD dissertation.

Have fun!
